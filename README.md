## üìã Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive toolkit for IoT security assessment, covering firmware analysis, MQTT protocol exploitation, device enumeration, and ethical hacking methodologies. Whether you're a security researcher, penetration tester, or IoT developer, this collection offers practical tools and techniques for identifying and addressing IoT security vulnerabilities.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Firmware Analysis Tools** - Binary analysis, extraction, and reverse engineering utilities
- **MQTT Security Testing** - Protocol fuzzing, authentication bypass, and message interception
- **Device Enumeration** - Network discovery and IoT device fingerprinting
- **Vulnerability Assessment** - Common IoT attack vectors and exploitation techniques
- **Ethical Hacking Guidelines** - Responsible disclosure and testing methodologies

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install required dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y binwalk hexdump nmap mosquitto-clients
pip3 install paho-mqtt scapy
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iot-security-toolkit.git
cd iot-security-toolkit

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Run device enumeration
./scripts/iot-enum.sh 192.168.1.0/24
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques

### Firmware Analysis
- **Binary Extraction** - Extracting filesystem from firmware images
- **Entropy Analysis** - Identifying encrypted or compressed sections
- **String Analysis** - Finding hardcoded credentials and configuration
- **Reverse Engineering** - Disassembly and code analysis

### MQTT Security Testing
- **Broker Discovery** - Finding unsecured MQTT brokers
- **Topic Enumeration** - Discovering available topics
- **Authentication Testing** - Bypass and brute force attacks
- **Message Injection** - Command injection and data manipulation

### Device Enumeration
- **Network Scanning** - Identifying IoT devices on networks
- **Service Fingerprinting** - Determining device types and services
- **Vulnerability Scanning** - Automated security assessment
- **Protocol Analysis** - Deep packet inspection

## üìö Documentation

### Firmware Analysis Guide
```bash
# Extract firmware filesystem
binwalk -e firmware.bin

# Analyze strings for sensitive data
strings firmware.bin | grep -E "(password|key|token)"

# Check for weak cryptographic implementations
hexdump -C firmware.bin | grep -E "(1234|admin|root)"
```

### MQTT Testing Examples
```python
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt

# Connect to broker
client = mqtt.Client()
client.connect("target-broker.com", 1883, 60)

# Subscribe to all topics
client.subscribe("#")

# Publish test message
client.publish("test/topic", "payload")
```

### Device Discovery
```bash
# Network scan for IoT devices
nmap -sS -O -sV 192.168.1.0/24 -p 22,23,80,443,1883,8080

# MQTT broker discovery
nmap -p 1883 --script mqtt-subscribe 192.168.1.0/24
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Guidelines

### Responsible Testing
- **Authorization Required** - Only test devices you own or have explicit permission
- **No Disruption** - Avoid causing service interruptions or data loss
- **Responsible Disclosure** - Report vulnerabilities through proper channels
- **Legal Compliance** - Follow applicable laws and regulations

### Testing Scope
- Personal IoT devices for security research
- Authorized penetration testing engagements
- Bug bounty programs with defined scope
- Educational and training environments

## üîç Vulnerability Categories

### Common IoT Vulnerabilities
- **Weak Authentication** - Default or weak credentials
- **Insecure Communication** - Unencrypted data transmission
- **Insufficient Update Mechanisms** - No secure firmware updates
- **Insecure Web Interface** - Web application vulnerabilities
- **Poor Physical Security** - Exposed debug interfaces

### OWASP IoT Top 10
